Automating lamp operation using speech recognition and RPi

# Description
The methodology of solving this system is based on usage
voice commands where the user will be able to issue a command to turn on the lamp and
turns off, gets the current temperature and air humidity, as well as the time and date.
The software that will be used for speech recognition is SpeechRecognition software which
supports a large number of languages, which enabled the realization of this project. Given that
this system is intended for home use, any kind of authorization is not required.
For more accurate recognition of the audio sample, an Internet connection is required, where the system sends
data to an online server that processes the audio sample and sends the system an interpreted response.
The assumption is that the final functionality will be limited, especially with regard to the precise interpretation of the audio sample, given that the Bosnian language is not fully supported.
compared to the English language which offers a high level of precision. The components used are not
intended for use for professional purposes, as well as for specified conditions, but can
serve for demonstrative purposes.
